1. Only displaying one row with 6 images which are the first 6 rows from the csv file, the csv file had 10,000 entries of image urls.


2.extra fields are not present, except for 'URL column' and 'caption column' to quey more data, so lets say that the csv file has 4 columns.
and we have to display extra info about the image, then that is not possible in the current setup.

So possible solution can be to have an option to add more fields in the query section


3..Filters are absent to query data. 

So if we have few fields in the dataset which can be used to filter imageURLs.
